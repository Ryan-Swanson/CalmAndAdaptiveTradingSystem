## Requirements

- Ignore node_modules, .next, __pycache__, etc.

## Implementation Plan

- Create .gitignore file at root.
- Add standard patterns for Node.js, Python, and general files.

## Test Plan

Verification: The file is created with the correct content. Check that git status ignores the patterns.

## Verification

Run git status after creating ignored files to confirm they are not tracked.

## Files Modified

- .gitignore (updated)
